# Project_name

Project template for @vizlab-uni projects with README and LICENCE guidelines. This template uses Markdown formating (see https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) using structure based on recommended Github guidelines (https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) and other guidelines like the University of Aveiro guideline (https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/).

The first section of the readme should contain an introduction presenting the project/code and how it works. Also, should reference the Vizlab and the project that it is inserted. Full credits will be done in the "Credits" section and in the "Published articles" subsection alongside each published work.
To insert figures use html style references like the one below:

## Published articles
This section is optional, but this section will need to be added later indicating works from Vizlab that used the code if published. Use the following as example when referencing an article:

**Name of the article in medium length trying to fill one line in bold**  
[AuthorFirstName AuthorLastName<sup>1</sup>](Profile link), [AuthorFirstName AuthorLastName<sup>2</sup>](Profile link), [AuthorFirstName AuthorLastName<sup>1</sup>](Profile link)  
[Filliation<sup>1</sup>](link to page),  [Filliation<sup>2</sup>](link to page)
